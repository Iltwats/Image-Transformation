# Image-Transformation
Project will be using an alternative color space that represents colors by human perception of color. The HSL color space uses the Hue, Saturation, and Luminance of the color. 

Using C++ I will transform a image into grayscale, illini orange, create spotlight in centre and add a watermark.
